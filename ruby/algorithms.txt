My REAL LIFE algorithm

Time scheduled.
Need to bathe before going out (y/n)
Need to prepear lunch (y/n) 
Time for travel

if need to bathe 
preparation time plus 30 min
if need to prepear lunch
preparation time plus 30 min
add time for travel

check time scheduled - preparation time  early than current time?
then "S***, I need to hurry"

otherwise make an alarm

when alarm rings
check time difference more than travel time.

Random reason 
" I will spray cologne"
" I will chew gum"
" I will eat outside"
" I 'll .. ' "
snooze 10 min, 

else.. 
"Oh, quick , I am late"
