Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
more organised storing of the data and accessing of the data.



Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.

Array are series of data with indexes and values.
it is easily accessed with an index to the value and directly store, retrieve and changed.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
data that need sorting
data that are indexed and needed to be edited often.

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
Hash is more like an array of records.
it has key and value , instead of index and value.


5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
Records that need to be filtered by the key or value.
creating a data record of a complex record.

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
iteration is useful for repeated simple instruction to establish the complex processes.


7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
finding a value
finding a key
sorting or rejecting

Blocks
8. What is a block?
a block is a piece of code that is flexible, reusable and can be passed to the method.


9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
block parameter is the value or variable input to the bock.
They are passed into the block by the method they are passed into.
yeild (x,y)
