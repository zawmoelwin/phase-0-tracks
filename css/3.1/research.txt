Each CSS property has a set of acceptable values. What do the following properties do? What are their acceptable values? (Feel free to experiment with them in JSFiddle.)


CSS properties are like classes. You assign the acceptable value to the properties is like calling a function inside the class. It will do the assigned value function to the section the property is applied to.

text-transform

text-transform property's acceptable value
lowercase: change to all lower case
uppercase: change to all uppercase of the section text content.
capitalize: Change first letter into capital.
none: keep the text as it was typed in the HTML file.
inherit: inherit from parent section's  CSS property.




display (to see this in action, you may need to set the width of your elements to narrower than 100%)

inline :        Default of all elements
inline-block :  block, but sits on a line
block :         make a block of section and div.
none :          Hide
run-in:         not supported by mozilla firefox.

Table group
  table: Force display of the section into a table.
  table-cell: Force display of the section into a table cell.
  table-column: Force display of the section into a table column.
  table-colgroup: Force display of the section into a table colgroup.
  table-header-group: Force display of the section into a table header group.
  table-row-group: Force display of the section into a table row group.
  table-footer-group: Force display of the section into a table footer group.

Flexbox : flex is rendered like a box. It is used when a page needed to be flexible
          to different screen sizes. It obsolete the need of using float and
          its margin does not overlap with its content.
         flex layout is the ability to alter its items' width and/or height to
         best fit in the available space on any display device.
         Positioning child elements is thus much easier, and complex layouts can
         be achieved more simply and with cleaner code, as the display order of the elements is independent of their order in the source code.

Grid :

list-style-type


You'll be answering these questions over and over again for all sorts of properties. Use the documentation linked above, or find your own resource that you find readable.
