I've made a super ambiscious project that has search algorithms for bus routing.
I am trying to structure my data with tables and trying to find an algorithms for it but 
found out it is too large for the time-frame.

I stopped in the middle of design stage, drawing database schema and pseudo code stage, and some exploratory coding as I end up keying in the data manually, and it doesnot fit the purpose of the assignment, familiar with the manipulation of the database.

I ended up with writing simple note program that have SQL command and it has ability to create tables, records according to the input of the user.

The program still lacks User interface as I do not have much time. Promise to improve it.
