What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux is Unix based, but unlike other commercial Unix systems, it is designed with a very open-ended, feature-minded approach.

It is opensource and developed with "Open Source development model". It is primarily developed as group effort by volunteers on the internet from all over the world. Anyone with enough interest can 
be part of development, debugging, and testing.



In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

In old times, consumers can only buy hosting services. It is too expensive to host a server on your own. With the invention of virtualisation technology, we can have limitless virtual servers from physical server hardware. Hosting services are limited in windows based or linux based or software installation. With VPS, you can fully customize the VPS and admin has full right over the virtual server.



Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Linux is Unix based, which is a server system, designed to be used by many users at once. It always ensure the system always stay safe. Running a program as root is considered security breach, as a root user can do anything even formatting the system disk running the OS. Softwares can have bugs or bad requests, so it is a good practice not to run programs as root user.
